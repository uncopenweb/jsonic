.. module:: uow.audio
   :synopsis: Namespace for the JSonic client.

The JavaScript API
==================

The client implements a JavaScript interface allowing web applications to speak text, play sounds, change playback properties, queue commands, manage independent audio channels, and cache results for low-latency playback.

Client concepts
---------------

The client consists of a set of named :term:`channels` that maintain independent :term:`queues` of :term:`commands`. A channel processes its queue sequentially in first in, first out order, though some commands are processed immediately (e.g., stop). Multiple channels can process commands at the same time, however. For example, the `default` channel might have one speech utterance queued while it is speaking another. At the same time, the `secondary` channel might process a volume change command followed by a command to play a sound.

Channels send :term:`notifications` of important events as they occur in two manners. First, channels invoke callback functions registered by an application for one or more kinds of notifications. Second, the channels return deferred results for each command before and after it is processed. The former technique is useful for listeners that need information across many commands. The latter is useful when an application wants information about particular commands.

The JSonic factory
------------------

.. function:: initJSonic

   Initializes the client API.
   
   :param args: Object with the following properties:
   
      defaultCaching (optional)

         True to enable all levels of caching as the default for calls to :meth:`say` and :meth:`play`. False to disable all caching except browser caching as the default for those methods. Defaults to false.

      jsonicURI (optional)
      
         String URI pointing to the root of the JSonic REST API. Defaults to `/`.     
 
   :type args: object

A channel invokes the :meth:`callback` or :meth:`errback` method on the `before` deferred before a command is processed in the channel queue. A channel invokes the :meth:`callback` or :meth:`errback` method on the `after` deferred after the channel has finished processing the command.
   
   .. method:: callAfter(func)

Example code
------------

The following examples assume an :class:`uow.audio.JSonic` instance with caching disabled by default exists in local variable `js`. The following code creates such an instance.

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   var js = uow.audio.JSonic();

Speaking text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To say an utterance on the :const:`default` channel and not cache the result, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.say({text : "This is some text to speak."});

To say an utterance on the same channel and cache the result for lower latency, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.say({text : "This is some text to speak.", cache : true});

To queue two sequential utterances on the :const:`default` channel, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.say({text : "This is some text to speak."});
   js.say({text : "I wait my turn."});   

To say two utterances simultaneously, one of the :const:`default` channel and the other on the :const:`custom` channel, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.say({text : "This is some text to speak."});
   js.say({text : "Ha! I like to interrupt.", channel : 'custom'});

Playing a sound
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To play a sound, letting JSonic choose the proper format (OGG or MP3) based on the browser capabilities, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.play({url : 'http://somewhere.com/sounds/sound_effect'});

where a file named :file:`sound_effect.mp3` and/or :file:`sound_effect.ogg` exists at the given URL.

Interrupting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To cease output on the :const:`default` channel and clear its queued commands, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.stop()

Changing voices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query the :const:`espeak` engine for its available voices, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.getEngineInfo('espeak').addAfter(function(response) {
      var voices = response.voices.values;
   });

To set an Italian voice for all following speech commands on the :const:`default` channel, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.setProperty({name : 'voice', value : 'it'});

Changing speech rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query the :const:`espeak` engine for its range of speech rates, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.getEngineInfo('espeak').addCallback(function(response) {
      var min = response.rate.minimum;
      var max = response.rate.maximum;
   });

To set the rate for all following speech commands on the :const:`default` channel, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.setProperty({name : 'rate', value : 250});

Changing volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set the volume for all following audio output on the :const:`default` channel, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.setProperty({name : 'volume', value : 0.5});

To set the volume for the current audio output and all following commands on the :const:`custom` channel, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.setProperty({name : 'volume', value : 0.25, immediate : true});

Listening for events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Say you have a JSonic event callback named :func:`onEvent` implemented as follows:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   function onEvent(event) {
      console.log(event);
   }

To register the callback for all events on the :const:`default` channel, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   var tok1 = js.addObserver(onEvent);

To register the callback only for sound start and error events on the :const:`custom` channel, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   var tok2 = js.addObserver(onEvent, 'custom', ['start-play', 'error']);

To unregister the callback on the default channel only, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.removeObserver(tok1);

Taking action before / after a command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Say you have the :func:`onEvent` function described above. You want it to execute in response to certain commands.

To execute the callback as the :const:`default` channel finishes speaking an utterance completely, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.say({text : 'I am a banana.'}).addAfter(onEvent);

To execute the callback as the :const:`default` channel starts speaking an utterance and either finishes speaking or encounters an error speaking, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.say({text : 'I am a banana.'}).callBefore(onEvent).anyAfter(onEvent);

To execute the callback with the voice configured on the :const:`default` channel immediately and when the command is processed by the channel, do the following:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   js.getProperty({name : 'voice'}).callBefore(onEvent).addAfter(onEvent);
