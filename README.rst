FAQ
===

What browsers does JSonic support?
----------------------------------

We've tested JSonic successfully on the following browsers. It should work on any browser supporting the HTML5 audio spec, however.

* Firefox 3.6, 3.7, 4, 5, 6b
* Safari 4, 5
* Chrome stable

Is this a clone of WebAnywhere?
-------------------------------

No. JSonic is a speech and sound API that web developers can use to create self-voicing web applications.

Is this an add-on like Firevox, Accessibar, FoxyVoice, etc.?
------------------------------------------------------------

No. See above.

Where's the JSonic server located?
----------------------------------

Wherever you'd like to run one. :)

I don't run a server for public use. You can run your own server by following the instructions in the documentation linked above.
